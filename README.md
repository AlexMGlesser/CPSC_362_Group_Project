# Notes for the Devs
Let's make sure that the code is well organized and documented. Every function should be in this form: 
(C++ example: For other languages just swap syntax but keep structure)

```
/* ==========================================================
Function Name: 
Inputs: [Parameter description and type]
Outputs: [Output description and type]
Function description
Status: Functional/Nonfunctional (is it working yet or not)
TODO: Any TODO information here. If none, emmit line
============================================================ */ 
int function(descriptive_variable, descriptive_variable, descriptive_variable) {
    // program here
    return output;
}
```

After a new function is added. Add the description and purpose into the explanation document.
